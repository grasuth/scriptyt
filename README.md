# scriptyt - Scriptable Youtube Player

## The goal

A scriptable youtube player window that can be driven remotely.  This to allow
code or somebody to drive the youtube player for projection, to explore
transtions and VJing.

## How

The first experiment is to make a chome app with a scriptable window and
attempt some transitions in code.  I want to keep latency of commands and
resulting youtube behaviour as low as possible.  So we start with simple
messaging and then have something to play with, transitions-wise.

## To think about

1. How to preload youtube windows and switch between them with CSS/canvas/JS
transitions.

2. A really easy way to record and replay sessions of videos

3. How to make a console for live youtube music VJing

4. How to analyse and beat match youtube videos.
